# Frontend Engineer - Home Assignment

This app is used to represent local restaurants to the customers.
Frontend is done with JavaScript (React) and Python (Django) for backend. Currently there are not any API implemented. Information is populated with fake REST API.
Components are styled with Material UI and pure CSS.
Idea is to summarize all the necessary information about restaurant such as name, address, phone, opening hours and average rate.
